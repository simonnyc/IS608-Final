        <div id="#chartContainer"> </div>
           <h5 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;font-style:italic"> 1. Background </h5>
                <p>  New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) conducts unannounced inspections of restaurants at least once a year.
                     Inspectors check for compliance in food handling, food temperature, personal hygiene and vermin control.
                     Each violation of a regulation gets a certain number of points.
                     At the end of the inspection, the inspector totals the points, and this number is the
                     restaurant's inspection score—the lower the score, the better the Grade. Restaurants with a score between 0 and 13 points earn an A, those with 14 to 27 points receive a B and those with 28
                     or more a C. Please note that not every restaurant receives one of these letter grades; inspectors can give other scores, primarily P or Z, or some version of “grade pending.”
                </p>

                <p>  The Health Department inspects about 24,000 restaurants a year to monitor compliance with City and State food safety
                     regulations. Since July 2010, the Health Department has required restaurants to post letter grades showing sanitary inspection
                     results.
                </p><br>

           <h5 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;font-style:italic"> 2. Purpose </h5>

               <p>   This project is intended to inform customers about the NYC’s restaurants’ sanitation inspection results.
                     It will help customers decide where to eat based on restaurants ‘sanitation inspection grade and violation severity.
               </p><br>

           <h5 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;font-style:italic"> 3. Description </h5>

                <p>  The objective of the project is to analyze the restaurant inspection data from NYC Open Data.
                     The main focus will be on the Borough of Manhattan and the analysis will be based on results from years 2010 - 2016.
                </p>

               <p>   The project application will interactively help customers select restaurants based on sanitation
                     inspection grade and type of cuisine.  For instance, before making a dinner reservation,
                     a customer may want to find all Tai cuisine restaurants
                     with lower score; hence better grade.
               </p>

           <h5 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;font-style:italic"> 4. Implementation </h5>
                <p>  The project implementation will adhere to the below high level best practice phases as follow:</p>

           <h6 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:14px;font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;"> 4.1 Data Acquisition </h6>

                <u1>
                    <li style="margin-left:50px">The data will be sourced from NYC OpenData site provided by DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left:50px">The dataset provides restaurant inspections, violations, grades and adjudication information.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left:50px">The dataset has NYC’s five boroughs. The data has been collected since 2010.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left:50px">The total data size for all NYC boroughs is over 150MB. However, due to size limitation, we will
                     focus only on the borough of Manhattan.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left:50px">Please note that establishments with inspection date of 1/1/1900 are new establishments that
                                    have not yet received a full inspection.</li>
                </u1>

           <h6 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:14px;font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;"> 4.2 Data Cleansing </h6>
                <p style="margin-left:50px">The data cleaning process will include handling outliers, null values, inappropriate negative values, and
                          conforming to the English language type set.  The tools used to clean the data will be mainly R language.
                        The data cleaning process will be done separately from the data presentation.
                </p>

            <h6 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:14px;font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;"> 4.3 Data Presentation </h6>
                <p>The data analysis will be presented via html, javascript, using Google chart.
                    The visualization will be using over time based trends, map based analysis, as well as interactive and
                    chart filtering analysis.
                    The visualization will comprise of eight charts.

                <p>The Health Department conducts unannounced inspections of restaurants at least once a year.
                     Inspectors check for compliance in food handling, food temperature, personal hygiene and vermin control.
                     Each violation of a regulation gets a certain number of points.
                     At the end of the inspection, the inspector totals the points, and this number is the
                     restaurant's inspection score—the lower the score, the better the Grade. <br><br>
                     From the analysis we can infer that restaurants that are part of chain or franchise tend to score better and have better grades.
                     Coffee shops also score better. However, they tend to fluctuate in scores perhaps as they mature in handling other foods
                     in addition to beverages, such as sandwiches and salads.<br>
                     In addition, neither restaurants geographical locations nor cuisine types have any impact on the score although
                     it seems little higher in uptown and downtown. However, location is not a strong indicator of sanitation score
                     differentiator.
